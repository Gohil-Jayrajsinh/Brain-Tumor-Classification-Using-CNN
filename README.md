# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Using-CNN
This project focuses on the development of a brain tumor classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It leverages MRI images to differentiate between patients with brain tumors and those without, achieving impressive results in terms of accuracy and reliability.
