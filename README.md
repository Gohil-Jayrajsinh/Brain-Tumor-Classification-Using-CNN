# üß† Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN

This project focuses on the development of a **brain tumor classification model** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It leverages MRI images to differentiate between patients with brain tumors and those without, achieving impressive results in terms of accuracy and reliability.

## üåü Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: 2,600 MRI images (1,300 labeled as tumor, 1,300 labeled as non-tumor).
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with data augmentation.
- **Performance**: Achieved **98% accuracy** with near-perfect **precision** and **recall** scores.
- **Real-World Application**: Aiding medical professionals with early detection and accurate classification of brain tumors, potentially reducing the burden on radiologists and improving patient outcomes.

## üè• Impact of the Project

Early detection of brain tumors is critical for effective treatment, and this model has the potential to assist healthcare professionals by providing fast, accurate diagnoses. The model not only reduces diagnostic errors but also accelerates the review process in high-demand medical environments.

## üìä Model Performance Overview

## Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix shows how well the model distinguishes between MRI scans with tumors and those without:

![Confusion Matrix](Confusion_Matrix.png)

- **True Positives**: 298 (correctly classified tumor cases)
- **True Negatives**: 288 (correctly classified non-tumor cases)
- **False Positives**: 12 (non-tumor classified as tumor)
- **False Negatives**: 2 (tumor classified as non-tumor)
